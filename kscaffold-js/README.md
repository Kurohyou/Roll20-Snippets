# REQUIREMENTS

- Node
- Yarn or NPM

# SETUP

Install dependencies:
```
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

I've included `lodash` as a dependency because it contains a lot of useful helper functions. These won't automatically be included in the sheet code.

# GENERATING YOUR SHEET

To generate your sheet, run
```
yarn build
# or
npm run build
```


The three sheet files (`sheet.html`, `sheet.css`, and `translation.json`) will be generated in the `sheet` folder

To remove these generated files, run 
```
yarn clean
# or
npm run clean
```

# DEVELOPING YOUR SHEET

See the following list for where to put code:

- Sheet PUG code -> `system.pug`
  - It's a good idea to store discrete sections in subfiles in the `articles` folder (see `attrs.pug`)

- Sheet styles -> `system.scss`
  - It might also be a good idea to break this up into discrete sections, but I haven't done that here.

- Constant values (lists of attributes, etc.) -> `javascript/constants.js`
  - These will be available anywhere on the sheet through `constants.<value>`

- Translation files
  - The translation file is generated by dynamically building json code and merging it with existing translation files. This is all done in `translate.js`.
  - Dynamic translation file generation allows you to quickly change things like skills lists and have the translation file update accordingly. 

- Javascript Functions -> `javascript/functions.js`
  - These must be attached to the kscaffold with `k.registerFunc({yourFunc})`

- Additional javascript resources
  - If the javascript is needed only to COMPILE the sheet, import it into `index.js` and add it into the argument to render. This will make it accessible to pug during compilation
  - If the javascript needs to run on the sheet actively while its being used, you'll need to include that inside the `kscript` at the bottom of `system.pug`
